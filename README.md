## Overview

The DataPower Universal Orchestrator extension allows for the remote management of cryptographic certificates within IBM DataPower environments. IBM DataPower is a highly available security and integration platform used to process workloads that require secure communication and data protection. This extension facilitates seamless operations such as inventory, addition, and removal of certificates in a variety of Certificate Stores.

DataPower uses certificates to secure communications, authenticate users, and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data transferred in and out of the system. Certificates play a crucial role in establishing SSL/TLS connections, signing and verifying messages, and enabling mutual authentication. By leveraging the DataPower Universal Orchestrator extension, administrators can efficiently manage these certificates, ensuring secure and uninterrupted operations.

## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version 10.1 and later.
