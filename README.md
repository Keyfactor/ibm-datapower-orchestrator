TODO Overview is a required section

## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version 10.4 and later.

## Support
The DataPower Universal Orchestrator extension is supported by Keyfactor for Keyfactor customers. If you have a support issue, please open a support ticket with your Keyfactor representative. If you have a support issue, please open a support ticket via the Keyfactor Support Portal at https://support.keyfactor.com. 
 
> To report a problem or suggest a new feature, use the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab. If you want to contribute actual bug fixes or proposed enhancements, use the **[Pull requests](../../pulls)** tab.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the DataPower Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.

## Create the FortiWeb Certificate Store Type

To use the DataPower Universal Orchestrator extension, you **must** create the FortiWeb Certificate Store Type. This only needs to happen _once_ per Keyfactor Command instance.


TODO Global Store Type Section is an optional section. If this section doesn't seem necessary on initial glance, please delete it. Refer to the docs on [Confluence](https://keyfactor.atlassian.net/wiki/x/SAAyHg) for more info


* **Create FortiWeb using kfutil**:

    ```shell
    # FortiWeb
    kfutil store-types create FortiWeb
    ```

* **Create FortiWeb manually in the Command UI**:
    <details><summary>Create FortiWeb manually in the Command UI</summary>

    Create a store type called `FortiWeb` with the attributes in the tables below:

    #### Basic Tab
    | Attribute | Value | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Name | FortiWeb | Display name for the store type (may be customized) |
    | Short Name | FortiWeb | Short display name for the store type |
    | Capability | FortiWeb | Store type name orchestrator will register with. Check the box to allow entry of value |
    | Supports Add | ✅ Checked | Check the box. Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Add |
    | Supports Remove | 🔲 Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Management Remove |
    | Supports Discovery | 🔲 Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Discovery |
    | Supports Reenrollment | 🔲 Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports Reenrollment |
    | Supports Create | 🔲 Unchecked |  Indicates that the Store Type supports store creation |
    | Needs Server | ✅ Checked | Determines if a target server name is required when creating store |
    | Blueprint Allowed | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if store type may be included in an Orchestrator blueprint |
    | Uses PowerShell | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if underlying implementation is PowerShell |
    | Requires Store Password | 🔲 Unchecked | Enables users to optionally specify a store password when defining a Certificate Store. |
    | Supports Entry Password | 🔲 Unchecked | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a password. |

    The Basic tab should look like this:

    ![FortiWeb Basic Tab](docsource/images/FortiWeb-basic-store-type-dialog.png)

    #### Advanced Tab
    | Attribute | Value | Description |
    | --------- | ----- | ----- |
    | Supports Custom Alias | Required | Determines if an individual entry within a store can have a custom Alias. |
    | Private Key Handling | Optional | This determines if Keyfactor can send the private key associated with a certificate to the store. Required because IIS certificates without private keys would be invalid. |
    | PFX Password Style | Default | 'Default' - PFX password is randomly generated, 'Custom' - PFX password may be specified when the enrollment job is created (Requires the Allow Custom Password application setting to be enabled.) |

    The Advanced tab should look like this:

    ![FortiWeb Advanced Tab](docsource/images/FortiWeb-advanced-store-type-dialog.png)

    #### Custom Fields Tab
    Custom fields operate at the certificate store level and are used to control how the orchestrator connects to the remote target server containing the certificate store to be managed. The following custom fields should be added to the store type:

    | Name | Display Name | Description | Type | Default Value/Options | Required |
    | ---- | ------------ | ---- | --------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
    | ServerUsername | Server Username | Api UserName for DataPower. (or valid PAM key if the username is stored in a KF Command configured PAM integration). | Secret |  | 🔲 Unchecked |
    | ServerPassword | Server Password | A password for DataPower API access.  Used for inventory.(or valid PAM key if the password is stored in a KF Command configured PAM integration). | Secret |  | 🔲 Unchecked |
    | ServerUseSsl | Use SSL | Should be true, http is not supported. | Bool | true | ✅ Checked |
    | InventoryBlackList | Inventory Black List | Comma seperated list of alias values you do not want to inventory from DataPower. | String |  | 🔲 Unchecked |
    | Protocol | Protocol Name | Comma seperated list of alias values you do not want to inventory from DataPower. | String | https | ✅ Checked |
    | PublicCertStoreName | Public Cert Store Name | This probably will remain pubcert unless someone changed the default name in DataPower. | String | pubcert | ✅ Checked |
    | InventoryPageSize | Inventory Page Size | This determines the page size during the inventory calls. (100 should be fine). | String | 100 | ✅ Checked |

    The Custom Fields tab should look like this:

    ![FortiWeb Custom Fields Tab](docsource/images/FortiWeb-custom-fields-store-type-dialog.png)

## Installation

1. **Download the latest DataPower Universal Orchestrator extension from GitHub.** 

    Navigate to the [DataPower Universal Orchestrator extension GitHub version page](https://github.com/Keyfactor/ibm-datapower-orchestrator/releases/latest). Refer to the compatibility matrix below to determine whether the `net6.0` or `net8.0` asset should be downloaded. Then, click the corresponding asset to download the zip archive.
    | Universal Orchestrator Version | Latest .NET version installed on the Universal Orchestrator server | `rollForward` condition in `Orchestrator.runtimeconfig.json` | `ibm-datapower-orchestrator` .NET version to download |
    | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Older than `11.0.0` | | | `net6.0` |
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net6.0` | | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `Disable` | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `LatestMajor` | `net8.0` | 
    | `11.6` _and_ newer | `net8.0` | | `net8.0` |

    Unzip the archive containing extension assemblies to a known location.

    > **Note** If you don't see an asset with a corresponding .NET version, you should always assume that it was compiled for `net6.0`.

2. **Locate the Universal Orchestrator extensions directory.**

    * **Default on Windows** - `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator\extensions`
    * **Default on Linux** - `/opt/keyfactor/orchestrator/extensions`
    
3. **Create a new directory for the DataPower Universal Orchestrator extension inside the extensions directory.**
        
    Create a new directory called `ibm-datapower-orchestrator`.
    > The directory name does not need to match any names used elsewhere; it just has to be unique within the extensions directory.

4. **Copy the contents of the downloaded and unzipped assemblies from __step 2__ to the `ibm-datapower-orchestrator` directory.**

5. **Restart the Universal Orchestrator service.**

    Refer to [Starting/Restarting the Universal Orchestrator service](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/StarttheService.htm).


6. **(optional) PAM Integration** 

    The DataPower Universal Orchestrator extension is compatible with all supported Keyfactor PAM extensions to resolve PAM-eligible secrets. PAM extensions running on Universal Orchestrators enable secure retrieval of secrets from a connected PAM provider.

    To configure a PAM provider, [reference the Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) to select an extension, and follow the associated instructions to install it on the Universal Orchestrator (remote).


> The above installation steps can be supplimented by the [official Command documentation](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/CustomExtensions.htm?Highlight=extensions).
